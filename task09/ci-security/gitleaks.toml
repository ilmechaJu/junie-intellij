# Task09 gitleaks template configuration (beginner-friendly)
# This file extends the default gitleaks rules and adds a small allowlist
# for sample files in this repository. Adjust paths to your project.

# Tip:
# - Prefer to fix false positives via more precise rules or path scoping.
# - Avoid allowlisting entire directories with real source code.
